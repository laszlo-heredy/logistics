Welcome!

Simply clone this repo, make sure "brew" and "docker" are installed locally, and run ./setup.sh.

This will download a simple docker image and curl localhost, which will run php on app/index.php.

If that does notwork, running app/index.php locally should be fine too, as long as you have PHP installed locally.
